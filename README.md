# RNN_Example
This project demonstrates a basic sequence prediction model using a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in TensorFlow and Keras.  Functionality:  The model is trained to predict the next number in a sequence. For example, given the input sequence [1, 2, 3], the model will learn to predict 4.
