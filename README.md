# RNN_Example
This project demonstrates a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow and Keras. It predicts the next number in a sequence using a trained RNN model. The model is trained on sequences of three numbers and predicts the fourth number. This example provides a basic understanding of RNNs for sequence prediction. #RNN #TensorFlow #Keras #DeepLearning
